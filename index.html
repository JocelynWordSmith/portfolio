                        <p>
                            I build things with other people. Before resigning from Teikametrics I managed people, projects, and programs to deliver 
                            large-scale Artificial Intelligence platforms as the Senior Technical Program Manager and Senior Software Engineering Manager 
                            of the Artificial Intelligence team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have a Bachelors in Creative Writing, a crippling reliance on spellcheck, and a Masters of Science in Computer Science
                            from Northeastern University. I worked on the Usability Design and software engineering for some of the highest traffic pages
                            in North America. I've helped a conversational AI platform understand idioms and multiple user intents,
                            built leaderboards and tournament managment for mobile games, created Large Scale Machine Learning devops pipelines, 
                            and worked on a lot (seriously, a lot) of full stack web development projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes I sling JavaScript and Python. I advocate for user-centric design. I build things that enable users regardless of 
                            their constraints. And I'd love to produce your game, write your horror story idea, or help you deliver large scale software platforms.
                        </p>

                        shops easily for use violations or payment issues. For the charts I used OOcharts.js which interprets
                        google analytics and I thought looked more in line with our app than the standard google charts.</p>

                    <p>I built reusable components that are shared across all digital sales sites while the bank transitioned from JSP pages to a responsive Front End.
                        Things like focus management utilities for screen readers, input validation and formatting that actually works properly with android
                        keyboards, a reusable template library that made rapid page deployment much easier, and updates to
                        accordions, headers, navigation, messaging, and more. There is a massive amount of code for all the
                        product lines, and some of what I did shows up on all all of them</p>
                    <p>The small business application was one of the first responsive rebuilds of a customer application. I was the
                        architect for how we brought state management into these application flows.
                        When I started at the bank I was on the deposits team, so most checking and savings account pages came across my desk.</p>
                    <p>For this application flow, I utilized redux for our state management as the user moves through the application process.
                        The length of the application steps and the content of each step is dynamic content based on previous selections, which necessitated
                        a robust state management library.</p>

                    <p>The research (non application) pages were largely what I worked on before I moved over to macro level
                        work on shared components.</p>

                    <p>The work I have done has made it on to nearly every responsive product page, and the effort to convert
                        legacy pages into the new responsive format is ongoing. It's pretty rad knowing that a few million
                        people have interacted with things that you made.</p>
